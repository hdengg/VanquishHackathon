# VanquishHackathon
Covisions is an interactive map that displays high risk roads/intersections. It accommodates all ages and different travelling methods and gives warnings accordingly.

We combined collision bike map data, VPD data, and VGH data and then use "injury type", "log", and "lat" to create data visualizations such as heat map and cluster map.

The heat map gives a general view of the road, where blue zones have lower number of accidents, and red zones have the higher number of accidents.

The cluster map displays the total number of accidents within one region. As the users zoom in to the roads, the map shows the past accident locations and in the area and with a mouse click, the user is able to see the severity of the accident, and the age of the casualty.
